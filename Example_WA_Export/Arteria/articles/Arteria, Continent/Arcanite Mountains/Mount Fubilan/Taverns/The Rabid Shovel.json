One of the owners is a member of a race that is common for the area, while the other owner's race is exotic in the area. One of the owners has no hidden secrets or unusual quirks, but the other suffers from mental illness. Before they owned the tavern, both owners worked there under the previous owner. The inspiration for the tavern's name was a local legend. It is a tavern of wealthy quality, and its main draw is its amateur open-stage night.\n\nOne of the owners of The Grappled Beech tends the bar because she enjoys doing the job herself. Her disposition is generally described as extremely reserved. She is truly attractive with brown skin and bright hair in a long, tangled style. Physically, she is very tall.\n\nOn a typical night, the clientele at The Grappled Beech can be described as subdued. On this occasion, there are around ten other people currently in the tavern. Some of them are playing a game of dice. At a table almost hidden in shadow, there is a paranoid looking figure. Their family was murdered by bandits/goblins/kobolds or some CR-appropriate threat, and they need help getting their revenge.\n\nThe rooms for rent at The Grappled Beech are wonderfully tiny and acutely dingy. There are currently five rooms available for rent. The cost for a night's stay is 4 sp, 8 cp.
