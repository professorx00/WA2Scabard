            <div class="user-css-vignette">The Charmed Tiger is owned by a divorced man and his sister, both of whom are members of a race that is common in the area. One of the owners has no hidden secrets or unusual quirks, but the other secretly runs an underground fight club in the basement of the tavern. Before owning the tavern, one of the owners lived a boring life, while the other made a living as a common thug. The inspiration for the tavern&#039;s name was a local legend. It is a tavern of modest quality, and its main draw is an eating challengeâ€”if you can eat it all, you don&#039;t have to pay.
<br /><span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>
The bartender at The Charmed Tiger is a middle-aged female gnome who is ugly. She is often awfully loud in disposition. Her skin is light, and she has grey hair, kept in a slicked-back style. Physically, she is kind of willowy.
<br /><span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>
On a typical night, the clientele at The Charmed Tiger can be described as particularly subdued. On this occasion, there are a few other people currently in the tavern. A couple of them are playing a game of darts.
<br /><span class="line-spacer d-block">&nbsp;</span>
The rooms for rent at The Charmed Tiger are spacious and unusually dirty. There are currently three rooms available for rent. The cost for a night&#039;s stay is 6 sp, 9 cp. If the party spends the night in the tavern, sounds of cheering, shouting, and struggling echo from the basement of the tavern.
