In reality, they are using Thieves’ Cant to pass the rogue a quest/ job offer or other message.\r\nGreeting\r\nPresumably, the roguish messenger seeking out your party knows your identity. The greeting they use identifies them to your rogue as a representative of a particular thieves’ guild.\r\nGreeting Code Speaker’s ID\r\nHey, girl, hey!

Either handwave this as done by an expert, or roll + 5 Dex (sleight of hand) + proficiency + expertise vs. PC’s Wis (perception). If Pickpocket fails, let PC respond as they choose; that’s the risk a pickpocket takes.\r\n\r\nNostalgia\r\nAs with many old friends catching up, the messenger says something like “I haven’t seen you since…” The exact phrasing does not matter. The important element is the time frame, which reflects the urgency of the message to follow.\r\nExample Urgency\r\n“I haven’t seen you in 6 months” Not urgent / optional\r\n“Wow, it’s been a few years” Low urgency\r\n“Can you believe it’s been over 10 years?” High urgency\r\n“Seems like you left the village a lifetime ago” Extreme urgency\r\n“Gosh, it feels like forever since I’ve seen you” Utmost urgency / Not optional\r\n\r\nCatching Up\r\nThe messenger mentions a relative of the PC. There are two elements to this innocent statement. First, the specific relative mentioned identifies the source of the message or quest. Second, the tenor of the statement reflects the subtext of the message. The tone of the message may be friendly, neutral, or hostile.\r\nRelation code Message sender\r\nUncle Government official\r\nGreat Uncle Monarch / Sovereign\r\nMother / Father Rogue’s superior in Guild\r\nGrandmother / Grandfather Guild Master\r\nCousin Rogue’s peer in Guild\r\nMother-in-law / Father-in-law Superior rank in allied Guild\r\nStep-Mother Member of rival Guild\r\nGreat Grandmother / Great Grandfather Over-Guild Official\r\nLittle brother / Little sister Guild initiate\r\nPuppy / Kitten PC’s actual family member\r\nDemented Murderer DM\r\nExample of Tone Implication\r\n“I was so sorry to hear about your Grandmother’s passing. What a tragedy.” (Hostile) Your Guildmaster is threatening to kill you if you botch this job\r\n“Your Uncle has so many nieces and nephews, I don’t know how he remembers all your names” (Neutral) The government official can hire someone else if you don’t take the job\r\n“Remember that time we shaved your Step-Mother’s chihuahua? That was funny. We were awful kids, she didn’t deserve that.” (Friendly) A member or official of a rival Guild pleads for your help. Perhaps they are willing to make peace, or claim previous hostility was due to a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nChit-chat\r\nThis part can vary the most. It gives the nature of the job or message, as well as additional information such as identifying targets, cautions, or other parameters. If necessary, the relations listed above can be used again with the same meanings. For example, “Your uncle says don’t forget to wish your step-mother a happy birthday,” meaning “a government official wants you to assassinate a rival guild leader.”\r\nCode Meaning\r\nBirthday Assassination\r\nBirthday Party Assassination of multiple targets\r\nNumber of Candles Number of Targets\r\nA small, intimate gathering No collateral damage; look like an accident\r\nCelebration, Wingding, Blowout The larger the “party,” the bigger the splash\r\nParty like it’s 999 No survivors\r\nParty planner Inside informant\r\nParty invitation intel already gathered\r\nBlack tie / formal Rogue must follow questgiver's guidelines\r\nCome as you are / informal Rogue has discretion on methods\r\nFamily reunion Guildwar\r\nVacation Kidnapping\r\nFamily vacation multiple kidnappings / hostage situation\r\nVacation postcards ransom demands\r\nVacation souvenirs proof of victim’s ID (e.g. signet ring or left big toe)\r\nAle run Smuggling contraband\r\nDeliver package Smuggling / delivering object\r\nSpecial Delivery Smuggling live cargo\r\nMarriage proposal Intimidate / threaten / blackmail\r\nDowry payoff money\r\nGossip Recon / spy / info gathering\r\nJoin the club covert infiltration\r\nFarm general money-making operation / heist\r\nVineyard high-stakes operation / heist, e.g. targeting a wealthy noble\r\nPlantation refers to long-term, multiple operations of entire Guild\r\nRanch Large scale operation, e.g. bilking an entire town\r\nGreenhouse Bank robbery\r\nGrocery market Rob merchant\r\nWindow box / Planter / Garden patch small scale heist / con\r\nProblem with rodents / worms / insects spy or informant in the operation\r\nProblem with rabbits embezzler in the operation\r\nDon't tell. It's a surprise. It’s ok to let other party members in on the job\r\nBring a date Get backup (presumably other PCs) but keep them in the dark regarding the op\r\nInvite your friends if you tell them, you have to kill them\r\nGive credit where credit is due frame someone else for the crime\r\nSignature / Signed reveal job originator to send a message\r\n\r\nEnough about me, how are you?\r\nThe messenger would gladly skip payment info. Contract negotiation is much more favorable for the quest-giver after the job is done. If the PC neglects to ask for payment, it’s their own fault. They can ask and negotiate by inquiring about the Messenger’s family.\r\n“How’s your little (tyke, baby girl, nephew, poodle, whatever)?” means “How much does the job pay?”\r\n“Oh, he’s great. He’s 9 now.” In-game, the number indicates a range on a scale of 1 – 20 how much the quest-giver is offering. Mechanically, you can roll for the money portion of a CR 9 monster’s hoard (magic items NOT included).\r\n“Really? I thought he was, like, 12.” or “So your older girl is 12, then?” This represents the PCs demand: I want level 12 payment for this job.\r\n”Yeah, but junior will be 10 next month.” This is the messenger’s counter-offer: level 10 payment.\r\n\r\nDo we have a deal?\r\nCode Meaning\r\nWill I see you at the harvest festival (or any other hometown gathering) this year? Will you take the job?\r\nYes, I’ll be there Yes, I’ll be there\r\nNo, I am otherwise engaged No, I am otherwise engaged\r\nGive my regards to your Granny A pox on thee, and your guild master as well\r\n…and have your pets spayed or neutered I’m going to spay and neuter your family members\r\n\r\nDM Note\r\n\r\n This can be a kind of puzzle for your rogue player.\r\nOther PCs should not be aware of the meaning; in fact, other players may not even realize thieves’ cant is being used. Most games, in my experience, don’t actually do anything with thieves’ cant, unless maybe just passing secret notes. I designed this hoping to avoid the passing of notes.\r\nYour rogue player should have a copy of this guide. Even so, they may misinterpret the message entirely. If they do, that could be even more fun.\r\nI tried not to over-complicate too much, so the passing of notes or private conversations with your rogue may still be necessary to convey specific quest details.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________-\r\n\r\nExample Conversation between my rogue Mystique and her “old friend” Samantha:\r\n\r\nSamantha: Hey, girl, hey! How are you doing? I haven’t seen you in…eternity. What are you up to?\r\nMystique: Oh, hi. I’ve been keeping busy with these yahoos.\r\nS: It’s so good to see you. I was just visiting your Great Aunt. She is such a sweetheart. You should look in on her more often.\r\nM: Yeah, maybe I will after we get back from our trip to Hrad Whit.\r\nS: Hrad Whit? You know, that road will take you right past Frawbtudt’s [Academy of Advanced Gladiation]. I hear they have a new games-meister since old Frawbtudt retired.\r\nM: Really?\r\nS: Yeah, and he’s having a huge birthday party. It’s supposed to be some big secret, I guess; a small, intimate affair. Members only, but they’re gonna party like it’s 999. If you’re in the area, you should totally join the club.\r\nM: Sounds intriguing. Maybe I’ll check it out.\r\nS: Cool.\r\nM: Say, how’s your nephew these days?\r\nS: Oh, he’s getting so big. You have no idea.\r\nM: You don’t say. Well can’t wait to see that big boy sometime.\r\nS: So, will you be home for the harvest festival this year? My Grandmother will be baby-sitting my nephew. Maybe you could meet him then.\r\nM: I’d love to. Good seeing you.\r\nS: Bring a date.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION:\r\n\r\nI’m a member of the Assassin’s Guild. This message is of utmost importance.\r\nIt’s been too long since you’ve reported to the Queen. She urges you (tactfully, not threatening) to complete this task.\r\nI’m on another assignment to Hrad Whit.\r\nFinish this job first: Assassination of the new master of Frawbtudt’s Academy and his crew. Leave no survivors. Also leave no evidence or collateral damage. Begin with a covert infiltration.\r\nHow much?\r\nUnspecified, but very generous. See the Assassins’ Guildmaster for payment.\r\nYou’ll need backup, but don’t tell them any details.\r\n\r\nFollow-up conversation with party:\r\nAnnabelle the Minotaur Fighter: I didn’t know you had any family.\r\nMystique the Assassin Rogue: I don’t, you numbskull. You think I want my parents to become some thug’s pets? My siblings tortured by some Demented Murderer?\r\nA: So do you or don’t you have family?\r\nM: I don’t. Not a single relative left. If you’re lucky, maybe someday I’ll swear I don’t know you either.\r\nA: I never understand anything you say.\r\n\r\nEdit: Formatting. In markdown. Which I started just before the \"new\" Reddit launched.\r\nEdit: Reformatted for consistency. Code:Message as /u/kendrone suggested. Thanks.\r\nEdit: Added a few more items. Thanks to /u/zonkovic and /u/Quajek for input. Edit: Thanks to /u/psiphre for formatting as pdf. See his/her comment below for link, since I have no idea how to link in Reddit's new format.",

For example, “Your uncle says don’t forget to wish your step-mother a happy birthday,” meaning “a government official wants you to assassinate a rival guild leader.”\nCode Meaning\nBirthday Assassination\nBirthday Party Assassination of multiple targets\nNumber of Candles Number of Targets\nA small, intimate gathering No collateral damage; look like an accident\nCelebration, Wingding, Blowout The larger the “party,” the bigger the splash\nParty like it’s 999 No survivors\nParty planner Inside informant\nParty invitation intel already gathered\nBlack tie / formal Rogue must follow questgiver&#039;s guidelines\nCome as you are / informal Rogue has discretion on methods\nFamily reunion Guildwar\nVacation Kidnapping\nFamily vacation multiple kidnappings / hostage situation\nVacation postcards ransom demands\nVacation souvenirs proof of victim’s ID (e.g. signet ring or left big toe)\nAle run Smuggling contraband\nDeliver package Smuggling / delivering object\nSpecial Delivery Smuggling live cargo\nMarriage proposal Intimidate / threaten / blackmail\nDowry payoff money\nGossip Recon / spy / info gathering\nJoin the club covert infiltration\nFarm general money-making operation / heist\nVineyard high-stakes operation / heist, e.g. targeting a wealthy noble\nPlantation refers to long-term, multiple operations of entire Guild\nRanch Large scale operation, e.g. bilking an entire town\nGreenhouse Bank robbery\nGrocery market Rob merchant\nWindow box / Planter / Garden patch small scale heist / con\nProblem with rodents / worms / insects spy or informant in the operation\nProblem with rabbits embezzler in the operation\nDon&#039;t tell. It&#039;s a surprise. It’s ok to let other party members in on the job\nBring a date Get backup (presumably other PCs) but keep them in the dark regarding the op\nInvite your friends if you tell them, you have to kill them\nGive credit where credit is due frame someone else for the crime\nSignature / Signed reveal job originator to send a message\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nEnough about me, how are you?\nThe messenger would gladly skip payment info. Contract negotiation is much more favorable for the quest-giver after the job is done. If the PC neglects to ask for payment, it’s their own fault. They can ask and negotiate by inquiring about the Messenger’s family.\n“How’s your little (tyke, baby girl, nephew, poodle, whatever)?” means “How much does the job pay?”\n“Oh, he’s great. He’s 9 now.” In-game, the number indicates a range on a scale of 1 – 20 how much the quest-giver is offering. Mechanically, you can roll for the money portion of a CR 9 monster’s hoard (magic items NOT included).\n“Really? I thought he was, like, 12.” or “So your older girl is 12, then?” This represents the PCs demand: I want level 12 payment for this job.\n”Yeah, but junior will be 10 next month.” This is the messenger’s counter-offer: level 10 payment.\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nDo we have a deal?\nCode Meaning\nWill I see you at the harvest festival (or any other hometown gathering) this year? Will you take the job?\nYes, I’ll be there Yes, I’ll be there\nNo, I am otherwise engaged No, I am otherwise engaged\nGive my regards to your Granny A pox on thee, and your guild master as well\n…and have your pets spayed or neutered I’m going to spay and neuter your family members\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nDM Note\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\n This can be a kind of puzzle for your rogue player.\nOther PCs should not be aware of the meaning; in fact, other players may not even realize thieves’ cant is being used. Most games, in my experience, don’t actually do anything with thieves’ cant, unless maybe just passing secret notes. I designed this hoping to avoid the passing of notes.\nYour rogue player should have a copy of this guide. Even so, they may misinterpret the message entirely. If they do, that could be even more fun.\nI tried not to over-complicate too much, so the passing of notes or private conversations with your rogue may still be necessary to convey specific quest details.\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\n____________________________________________________________________________________-\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nExample Conversation between my rogue Mystique and her “old friend” Samantha:\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nSamantha: Hey, girl, hey! How are you doing? I haven’t seen you in…eternity. What are you up to?\nMystique: Oh, hi. I’ve been keeping busy with these yahoos.\nS: It’s so good to see you. I was just visiting your Great Aunt. She is such a sweetheart. You should look in on her more often.\nM: Yeah, maybe I will after we get back from our trip to Hrad Whit.\nS: Hrad Whit? You know, that road will take you right past Frawbtudt’s [Academy of Advanced Gladiation]. I hear they have a new games-meister since old Frawbtudt retired.\nM: Really?\nS: Yeah, and he’s having a huge birthday party. It’s supposed to be some big secret, I guess; a small, intimate affair. Members only, but they’re gonna party like it’s 999. If you’re in the area, you should totally join the club.\nM: Sounds intriguing. Maybe I’ll check it out.\nS: Cool.\nM: Say, how’s your nephew these days?\nS: Oh, he’s getting so big. You have no idea.\nM: You don’t say. Well can’t wait to see that big boy sometime.\nS: So, will you be home for the harvest festival this year? My Grandmother will be baby-sitting my nephew. Maybe you could meet him then.\nM: I’d love to. Good seeing you.\nS: Bring a date.\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nTRANSLATION:\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nI’m a member of the Assassin’s Guild. This message is of utmost importance.\nIt’s been too long since you’ve reported to the Queen. She urges you (tactfully, not threatening) to complete this task.\nI’m on another assignment to Hrad Whit.\nFinish this job first: Assassination of the new master of Frawbtudt’s Academy and his crew. Leave no survivors. Also leave no evidence or collateral damage. Begin with a covert infiltration.\nHow much?\nUnspecified, but very generous. See the Assassins’ Guildmaster for payment.\nYou’ll need backup, but don’t tell them any details.\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nFollow-up conversation with party:\nAnnabelle the Minotaur Fighter: I didn’t know you had any family.\nMystique the Assassin Rogue: I don’t, you numbskull. You think I want my parents to become some thug’s pets? My siblings tortured by some Demented Murderer?\nA: So do you or don’t you have family?\nM: I don’t. Not a single relative left. If you’re lucky, maybe someday I’ll swear I don’t know you either.\nA: I never understand anything you say.\n<span class=\"line-spacer d-block\">&nbsp;</span>\nEdit: Formatting. In markdown. Which I started just before the &quot;new&quot; Reddit launched.\nEdit: Reformatted for consistency. Code:Message as /u/kendrone suggested. Thanks.\nEdit: Added a few more items.
