A fit, silverhaired\nhalf-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a\nfighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years\nin the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast.\nUpon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his\noriginal home.\nDaran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a\ndevout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from\nthe depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant,\nready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution\nagainst any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though\nhe is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on\nhappenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news\nwith fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to\nhold to these virtues.\nDaran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would\nlike to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a\nlesson. He tells the characters that it's time someone took\na stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff. Daran\nknows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap\nhouse, but he can also tell the characters that the main\nRedbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the\nruin at the east edge of town. (See the \"Tresendar Manor\"\nsection for more information.)\nQuest: Old Owl Trouble. Daran has heard stories\nfrom prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that\nsomeone is digging around in the ruins known as Old\nOwl Wel!. More disturbingly, several prospectors have\nreported being chased from the area by undead. He asks\nthe characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march\nnortheast of Phandalin, and find out who's there and\nwhat they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an\nold watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as\nNetheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be\ndormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see \"Old\nOwl Well\" (page 29).\nJOINING THE ORDER OF THE GAUNTLET\nIf the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates Old\nOwl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain\nmembers of the group to urge them to join the Order of the\nGauntlet. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues\nof the order, such as honor and vigilance. If a character\nagrees, Daran awards the person the title of Cheval!.",
