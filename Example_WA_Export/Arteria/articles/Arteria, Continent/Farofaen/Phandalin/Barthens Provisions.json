(For prices, see \"Adventuring Gear\" in the\nrulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are\ndirected to the Lionshield Coster (see that section).\nThe proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding\nhuman male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly\nmanner. He employs a couple young clerks (Ander and\nThistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait\non customers when Barthen isn't around.\nDelivering the Supplies. If the characters began play\nwith the \"Meet Me in Phandalin\" adventure hook, their\norders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen's.\nBarthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character)\nand takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If\nthe characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker's capture,\nBarthen is saddened by the news and encourages the\nparty to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren\na friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost\nmine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills. If the\nparty hasn't already learned details of the mine from\nSildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 15\nIntelligence (History) check can relate the information\nfrom the first two paragraphs of the \"Background\" section\nat the start of the adventure.\nBarthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker\nbrothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere\noutside town. Barthen hasn't seen them in a ten day and\nexpects the brothers to return \"any day now\" to resupply.\nWhat Barthen doesn't know is that Tharden is dead and\nNundro is a prisoner in the mine.

If the characters ask Barthen how\nbusiness is going, the shopkeeper tells them that the\nRedbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down\nlocal businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority.\nIf the characters seem of a mind to do something about\nit, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping\nGiant tap house.",
