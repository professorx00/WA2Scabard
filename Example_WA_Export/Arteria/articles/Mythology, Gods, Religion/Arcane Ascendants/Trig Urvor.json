She started a small school and she attracted beings who were naturally gifted in the arcane, others who thirsted for knowledge, yearned for freedom, and as her following grew even more, she attracted people who, even though they had no arcane potential themselves still wished to come out from under the heel of the Druids, and to see arcane magic flourish.\r\nAfter seeing all the brilliant minds that came to her school, and the success the small school achieved; Urvor founded the Spell Weavers an organization she hoped would form a solid core to fight for the rights of all Arcanists, form more schools, and spread the word of Mystra throughout all of Ethillann.
