If a magical item had no charges, but did have a limited number of uses, then the energy released by a glowstone would bestow upon the item an extra use. The amount of charges of magical energy lost was always equal to the amount transferred. Whenever transferring this energy to an item a glowstone's radiance would pulsate and flicker.

This beam was known to be capable of easily cutting through flesh, wood, and stone.[2]\n\nOnce fully drained of their energy by natural means a glowstone would grow dim and crumble into dust. If deliberately destroyed through use of magic, physical force, or a disintegrate spell then they would violently explode with a blast of radiant light.",
